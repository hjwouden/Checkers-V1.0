           <h2>Final Requirements</h2>
           <hr>
            <ul>
            
            <li>Documentation explaining how you implemented your game and how it satisfies the remainder of the
            requirements. The documentation should be in a file named documentation.html, with a link to the
            documentation file on the project description page.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yes, this is the documentation page and a link to this can be found in all other pages of the site.</li>
                </ul>
                
           
            <li>Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>style.css has many different variations to represent a piece on the board, when a board piece changes it simply changes the class name of the table cell when the
                    table is drawn it applys the css accordingly. Below is an example css style for a class</li>
                    <ul><li><code>.redPC{ <br> background-image:url('Images/RedPC.png'); <br> width: 50px; <br> height: 50px; <br> }</code></li></ul>
                    <li>JavaScript file contains a function called DrawCurrentGame(..) which takes a GameBoard array, it changes the class of each cell in the table to match the
                    given number in the gameboard array. This way the model says separate from the view as well as the model only cares about the numbrer in the gameboard array and the
                    view is constructed in other js files.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <li>User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Above the gameboard there are 2 text boxes, Players can enter their boxes in the respective red box or white box
                    to be called by their name in the game prompt to the right of the screen. The names will be used in messages telling which team's
                    move it is, how many pieces they have left, and who wins.</li>
                    <li>Also, above the gameboard are select options for different game variations, These are different inital setups of checkers games
                    the players can select what game variation they want and enter their names. Pressing the New Game button will draw the game board and
                    begin the game.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <li>User input in the form of mouse clicks</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>board.js adds click event handlers to each square on the game board, when a piece is clicked it goes to the Piece clicked event function which will check the following:</li>
                    <ul><li>Is it the first piece being highlighed, is it the teams piece whos turn it is, if yes, then change it to look highlighted</li>
                    <li>Is it the 2nd click, if so is it a valid move, is it diagional to the piece, in the right direction, is it a jump. if so then move the piece accordingly</li></ul>
                    <li>When New Game button is clicked, checks to get the names entered in name boxes, sets up selected game varition, starts a new game.</li>
                </ul>
           
            <li>Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are several instances of modification of HTML using innerHTML and DOM functions. In board.js : lines 160-180 show the code for updating the message
                    board to the right of the game board, everytime a piece is selected it is added to the message board, which keeps history of the game and can be scrolled down to
                    see old messages. </li>
                    <ul><li><code>179::paragraph.innerHTML = message;</code></li></ul>
                    <li>lines 98-102 of board.js show how DOM is used to retrieve player names from the board game</li>
                    <ul><li><code>var redname = document.getElementById("redName").value; <br> RedPlayerName = redname; <br> GameHistoryUpdate( RedPlayerName + "'s  Turn");</code></li></ul>
                </ul>
           
            <li>Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid page</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Code loads a local XML file which contains the top 5 fastest win times. These can not be adjusted and are fixed values. This also does not work in Google Chrome
                    as it does not allow loading local XML files, open in Safari or IE to see the results. Box is located on lower right of game grid page and also index page.</li>
                </ul>
            
            <li>Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The game has HTML5 audio controlled by the JavaScript. When a piece is clicked, it plays
                    an mp3 sound. There are seperate sounds for selecting a piece, moving a piece, jumping, invalid moves, becoming a
                    King, and winning the game. An example of this can be found in Scripts/model.js : line 91 :
                    <code>var clickSound = new Audio("Sounds/FX1.mp3"); </code> on highlighting a piece the sound is then played by :<code> clickSound.play(); </code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
            <li>Game logic code</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Game functions properly and does not allow illegal moves, or going out of turn.</li>
                    <li>Game properly kings pieces when they reach the opponents back row.</li>
                    <li>When the game is over a sound will play and a message will come up on the display board to the right telling who won.</li>
                    <li>To play again the user can then select new game above the game baord.</li>
                    <li>Issue: Double jumps are not supported in this version. After a Player makes a single jump, it becomes the other teams turn.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
