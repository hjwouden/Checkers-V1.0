            <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select if playing 1 player or 2 players.</li>
                    <li>Click one of your teams pieces, then on the spot you want to move it to.</li>
                    <li>Jump over the other teams pieces to remove them from the board.</li>
                    <li>Win by removing all of the other teams pieces!</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2>Rules</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gameboard is a 8x8 table, alternating white and black squares.</li>
                    <li>Each Team has 12 pieces. Pieces stay on black squares at all times. </li>
                    <li>Players move their teams pieces one square at a time diagonally.</li>
                    <li>After one move it is the other players turn to move.</li>
                    <li>Pieces must be moved forward in all moves, unless piece is a king.</li>
                    <li>A piece becomes a king by reaching the furthest row of the opponents
                    side</li>
                    <li>A jump happens when a piece "Jumps" over an opponents piece to get
                    to an open square to get to the open square behind it.</li>
                    <li>When a jump is available, the player must jump.</li>
                    <li>The winner is the player who has caputured all the pieces of the
                    opposing team</li>
                </ol>

             <h2>UPDATED: Preliminary Software Design</h2>
                <h3>Variables</h3>
                <p>//Integer values used in arrays / (validate move)<br>
                //0 = White Space, (Invalid Move)(emptyspace)<br>
                //1 = Red Piece, (Valid Move)<br>
                //3 = Red Piece King<br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Num_Players = (1 or 2)</li>
                    <li>UPDATED: gameboard and valid moves will be single arrays, size 64. holding values represented as above. will use loops to check values in the tables to see when moves or valid or to draw the current game map out</li>
                    <li>StartBoard = <br>

                    <li>VaildMove[]; //similar array as above, mapped to show all valid moves player can make, function validate move will check this with the move player is making to see if player will be allowed to make the move</li>
                    <li>CurrentGame[]; //similar as above, current game layout, updated after each move.</li>
                    <li>function newGame() { //sets gameboard up for a new game. pieces in default positions, need prompt to ask if sure you want to start a new game (progress will be lost) } </li>
                    <li>function UpdateMove() { //1.validateMove(from, to, currentgame); 2.updateGameArray(from, to); 3.updateview(currentgame); } </li>
                    <li>function validateMove(from, to, currentgame) { if move from -> to is valid, does not hit any other pieces, then return true}</li>

                    Position on board will be kept by grid number system.(2d array of ints) When object is clicked, square
                    is sent to first function that will make sure it contains a piece of that players
                    team.

                    <li>CheckSquareEmpty(position) //check to see if 2nd click is an empty square, then check if the move is legal.</li>
                    <li>CheckMove(position1,position2) //if CheckMove returns true, move is legal and game board is updated with move on HTML table</li>
